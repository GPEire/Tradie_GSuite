## 3. Major Competitors (AU Market Focus)

| Provider | Type | Key Strengths | Gaps (vs. MVP) | AU-Specificity |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ServiceM8 | Tradie CRM | Mobile-first, scheduling, AU integrations | Limited quote approval, clunky Gmail workflow, expensive at scale | High |
| Buildxact | Builder ERP | Estimating, project mgmt, AU compliance | Not native to Gmail, hard for SMBs, cumbersome onboarding | High |
| Simpro | Field Service Mgmt | Inventory, invoicing, AU compliance | Complex, requires platform migration, limited AI/automation | High |
| TradieM8 | Quoting/CRM | Price list management, basic comms | No email plugin, limited workflow automation, not AI-powered | Medium |
| Xero Projects | Accounting/PM | Integrated with AU accounting, billing | Not optimized for Gmail, lacking quoting \& comms automation | High |

**Note:**
Generic CRM tools (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive) offer customization but fail on AU compliance, local language, and seamless Gmail integration. Many SMBs report frustration with onboarding and churn.
