# The feedback on 'Builders/Carpenters: Volume of Client Communications:' could be an idea for an MVP which is an email extension. It would use AI to go through the builders/tradies inbox, group emails from customers, be able to price options, send the pricing quote to builder for approval before sending to the client.

Your MVP concept—an AI-powered email extension for builders/tradies that scans inboxes, groups client emails by project, prices options, and sends quotes for internal approval before release—is strongly supported by user feedback and clear market gaps:

**Market Validation \& Challenge Fit**

- Builders, carpenters, and other tradies report major frustration with high volumes of customer emails, especially regarding pricing and options for projects. Keeping up with communications, organizing client requests, and quickly preparing accurate quotes are top pain points in the Australian market.[^1]
- On Reddit and industry forums, several tradespeople voice demand for tools that automate quote creation and customer communications, ideally by integrating with their email and document systems.[^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]
- Existing solutions do NOT fully automate the workflow as you describe—most platforms still require manual review or cumbersome template use, and few offer the “approve before send” capability tailored for team operations.

**What Users Say and Want**

- Many want AI systems that:
    - **Read their emails and extract relevant client requests, automatically grouping by job/project**.
    - **Draft pricing and options based on internal price lists or Google Sheets, then queue drafts for approval before emailing clients**.[^4][^7][^6]
    - **Work entirely inside Gmail/Outlook or as an extension, without requiring a new separate platform**.[^5][^2]
- Some have tried no-code tools like n8n, Make.com, and ChatGPT for parts of this workflow, but struggles remain with reliable extraction, pricing, and the approval flow before sending quotes to customers.[^6][^2]

**Current MVPs \& Gaps**

- DIY solutions exist (often using Zapier/n8n and ChatGPT), but these require significant setup, tech expertise, and often lack builder-specific logic and a user-friendly review/approval process.[^2][^6]
- A few platforms (like Lutra.ai and BuildPass.ai) are starting to add AI document review and automation, but their email quote workflow is still generic and not tightly streamlined for Aussie tradies or multi-project handling.[^8][^9]
- Most CRM/ERP options are still too heavyweight and not designed for small teams to review/send price quotes straight from their own inbox.

**Conclusion**

- There is clear evidence that your proposed MVP directly addresses the biggest communications pain points for Aussie builders/carpenters.[^3][^4][^5][^6][^1]
- An email extension that leverages AI to extract, group, price, and internally approve quotes before sending could drive strong adoption, especially if it integrates with Gmail/Outlook and Google Sheets, is simple for teams to use, and is tailored for the construction/trade environment.
